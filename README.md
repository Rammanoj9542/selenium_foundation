# Selenium Automated Testing Project

## Overview

This project aims to automate testing processes using Selenium WebDriver. Selenium WebDriver is a powerful tool for automating web application testing across different browsers. This README file provides an overview of the project structure, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and other relevant information.

## Features

- **Cross-browser Testing**: Test web applications across multiple browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement the Page Object Model design pattern for better organization and maintenance of test scripts.
- **Test Reporting**: Generate detailed test reports for analysis and tracking using frameworks like TestNG or JUnit.
- **Parallel Execution**: Execute tests in parallel to reduce test execution time and improve efficiency.
